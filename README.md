## Challenges we faced and resolutions we found.

1) We found time estimates difficult to accurately gauge. Something that sounded quick and easy could become a real time consummer: For example, using the createdAt timestamp to diplay the date that a post was submitted. We realized that it returns a large json object which can't easily be parsed and manipulated. The work-around we found was the JSON.stringify method followed by some good-old slicing. The createdAt data can't be overwtitten so we attached it via post.newDate:

```javascript
    posts.map((post) => {
      let announcements = post.announcements.split("\n");
      post.announcements = announcements;
      //prep date for display
      let newDate = JSON.stringify(post.createdAt).slice(1, 11);
      newDate = newDate.slice(5, 7) + '/' + newDate.slice(8) + '/' + newDate.slice(0, 4);
      post.newDate = newDate;
      return post;
```
